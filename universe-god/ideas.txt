create an habitable earth with molecules : water, hydrogen, oxygen

spark bacterial life onto plants

bacterial mutagen to animals with intelligence

balancing the ecosystem

First :
  - create chemicals elements : oxygen and hydrogen
  - create water : 20 hydrogen + 10 oxygen/mL
  - create temperature (water is frozen) : make a sun
    - hydrogen : 75, helium : 15, oxygen : 10
    - sun have a power : it can generate ressources/sec
    - it can be upgradable, but can't have more than 1
  - generate an atmosphere : build an atmosphere generator
  - amount of cells is limited by the number of water :
    - 10 cells/mL of water
    - 1 cell generate 0.1 meat
  - builds to create hydrogen/oxygen/helium per sec
